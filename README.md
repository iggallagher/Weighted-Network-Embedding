# Weighted-Network-Embedding

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks reproducing the synthetic and real data examples from the JASA paper *Spectral embedding of weighted graphs*. If you use this code in your own experiments, please cite the following publication:

Gallagher, I., Jones, A., Bertiger, A. Priebe, C. & Rubin-Delanchy, P. (2021). Spectral embedding of weighted graphs. *Journal of the American Statistical Association*.

The algorithms described in these notebooks use the <a href="https://github.com/iggallagher/Spectral-Embedding">Spectral-Embedding</a> package, which includes many other spectral embedding techniques.
